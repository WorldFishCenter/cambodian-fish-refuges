Looks like lwb\_depth\_dry\_m and lwb\_area\_wet\_ha are almost
orthogonal and are highly correlated with axis 1 and 2. For axis 3 and 4
looks like we can use some more: no\_channel,
rf\_area\_connected\_in\_dry\_season\_ha. Weâ€™ll probably add
dist\_village and dist\_market because they are interesting. The only
categorical variable that seems to be strongly correlated with these
categorical ones is channel\_type.
