## Results

  - The mean total dissimilarity (measured using the percentage
    difference) ranged between 50% \[28%, 72%\] for refuges in community
    ponds within agricultural land not prone to flooding and 57% \[34%,
    77%\] for refuges in reservoirs for irrigation (Figure 2, top
    panel).

  - When decomposing these dissimilarities into those due to losses and
    gains due to species abundances, we found that dissimilarity losses
    account for a larger amount than gains across all refuge categories
    (probability of direction, p.d., 0.95; Figure 2, mid and bottom
    panel).

  - When looking at the random effects, we also found that there is no
    substantial difference between the variability ofdifferences between
    the beta-diversity index isappear to be larger across CFRs than
    across years

  - We found that out of the 149 species sampled during the dry season,
    7 species showed significant (log) differences in their abundances;
    namely *Puntius sp cf masyai*, *Pristolepis fasciata*, *Trichogaster
    microlepis*, *Notopterus notopterus*, *Hampala macrolepidota*,
    *Labiobarbus siamensis*, and *Parambassis apogonoides*.

  - Another 24 species showed important differences but were not
    considered significant at the 0.05 level after correcting for
    multiple testing.

  - When comparing different types of species, we found that, on
    average, black and grey fish species are more likely to experience
    losses in abundances than white fish species (p.d. 0.96 and 0.99
    respectively). Specifically, the average difference in log
    abundances per species between the end and the beginning of the dry
    season was -0.18 \[-0.62, 0.24\], -0.13 \[-0.34, 0.08\], and 0.53
    \[0.03, 1.01\] for black, grey, and white species respectively.

  - The model that explored covariates of beta-diversity had a R2 of
    0.36 \[0.21, 0.49\] for the dissimilarity in per-species abundance
    due to losses and 0.2 \[0.09, 0.33\] for the dissimilarity due to
    gains.

  - Specifically, CFRs connected to the adjacent rice fields through
    culverts were likely to experience lower losses of species abundance
    during the dry season particularly when compared to CFRs without
    channels or those with earth channels (p.d. 0.72 and 0.96; Figure
    4A)

  - Similarly, CFRs with culverts experienced larger gains in species
    abundances when compared to CFRs without channels (p.d. 0.999).

  - We found that the (log) area of the CFR water body had a positive
    association with the dissimilarities due to losses in species
    abundance (p.d. 0.99; Figure 4B).

  - In contrast, the rice-field area connected to the refuge during the
    wet season had a negative association to losses (p.d. 0.99; Figure
    4C).

  - However, the effect size and the likelihood of these associations is
    considerably smaller (p.d. 0.88 and 0.85 respectively).
